# Car Object Detection with YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project implements a car object detection pipeline using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It allows you to detect and localize cars in images or videos.

## Overview

This project leverages the power of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and OpenCV for image and video processing.  It's designed to be easily deployed and used for various applications.

## Features

*   **Car Detection:** Detects cars in images and videos.
*   **YOLOv8:** Uses the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model from Ultralytics.
*   **OpenCV:** Employs OpenCV for image and video handling.
*   **Easy Setup:**  Simple installation using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt`.
*   **[Optional: If you have an API] API Endpoint:**  Provides an API endpoint for easy integration with other applications.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip` package manager

## Installation
